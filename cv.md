## About me:
I am from Ukraine, I'm live in village of Velikiy Burluck, but because of the war, I moved to Kharkov, since my village is now an occupied territory. I am 15 years old.


I have many hobbies: I sing, draw, go in for sports.I started learning programming a year ago.I also like to travel, I have traveled almost all of Ukraine, but have not yet been abroad.I like horror and fantasy films like Harry Potter, The Witch and of course the Marvel universe. From horror stories I liked It and the ghosts of Bly Manor. For other scary films, I'm still mentally tunedn't in.


With animals, I like both cats and dogs, since I have both of them at home and I donâ€™t argue about who is better. I also have a Corella parrot at home.
